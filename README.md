# Route Finder Documentation

## Overview

The Route Finder is a Java program designed to calculate the shortest path between various landmarks on the University of Ghana campus. It utilizes the Mapbox API to retrieve distance and duration matrices for both driving and walking routes. The program then uses these matrices to build a graph and find the shortest path based on user inputs.

The program uses several algorithms and techniques to achieve the desired functionality. Below is a list of these algorithms, along with an explanation of their techniques and how they contribute to the program's efficiency:

### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Technique Used**: Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This algorithm is effective for graphs with non-negative weights and ensures that the shortest path is found efficiently.

- **Usage in Program**: In the `Graph` class, the `dijkstra` method implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path based on the travel mode (driving or walking). The weights used for the graph are `durationCar` for driving and `durationWalking` for walking.

- **Efficiency Contribution**: Dijkstra's algorithm offers a time complexity of \(O((V + E) \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges. This ensures that the shortest path is found efficiently, even in relatively large graphs.

### 2. Graph Construction and Edge Weighting

- **Technique Used**: The program constructs a graph where nodes represent landmarks and edges represent the paths between them. Each edge is weighted based on travel distance and duration, corresponding to the selected mode of transportation.

- **Usage in Program**: In the `RouteFinder` class, the graph is constructed using the `Graph` class. Nodes are added with their positions and names, and edges are added with weights for driving and walking modes (`distanceCar`, `durationCar`, `distanceWalking`, `durationWalking`).

- **Efficiency Contribution**: Accurate graph construction ensures that shortest path algorithms, like Dijkstra's, operate efficiently. Proper edge weighting enables the program to reliably find the shortest and most appropriate routes based on the selected travel mode.

### 3. API Integration

- **Technique Used**: The program integrates with the Mapbox API to retrieve up-to-date distance and duration data between landmarks. This offloads complex geographical calculations to the API and ensures accuracy.

- **Usage in Program**: The `getMapboxMatrix` method sends a request to the Mapbox API, which returns matrices of distances and durations for the specified landmarks and travel mode. This data is then used to weight the edges of the graph.

- **Efficiency Contribution**: By leveraging the Mapbox API, the program ensures accurate and current data for route calculations. This approach also improves efficiency by delegating complex computations to a specialized service.

### 4. Interactive User Interface

- **Technique Used**: The program employs a command-line interface to interact with the user. This interface guides the user through selecting the start and end points, the travel mode, and any waypoints.

- **Usage in Program**: The interactive part of the program is handled in the `main()` method, where the user is prompted to make selections and input data. The program then processes this input to find and display the corresponding route.

- **Efficiency Contribution**: The interactive interface ensures that users can easily provide input and receive results without needing to understand the underlying code. This improves the overall user experience and makes the program more accessible to non-technical users.
